# **Introduction to Medical Information Security**  
## **Week 1 — Foundations of Medical Information Security**

---

# **Learning Topics**
- Definition and significance of information security  
- Health data context and healthcare system environment  
- Distinct characteristics of health data  
- Case study analysis and class discussion  

---

# **Definition of Information Security**
## **Information Security**
- Protection of information to maintain:  
  - **Confidentiality**  
  - **Integrity**  
  - **Availability**  
- Conceptual framework: **CIA Triad**  
- Essential for healthcare systems requiring “continuous and reliable access to accurate health information”

---

# **Importance in the Healthcare Sector**
- Health data = **highly sensitive personal information**  
- Impacts of data breaches:  
  - Risks to patients (e.g., discrimination, stigmatization)  
  - Organizational risks (e.g., service disruption, reputational damage)  
- Real-world examples:  
  - Ransomware attacks on hospitals  
  - Unauthorized access to EMR systems

---

# **Components of Information Security**
## **Technical Measures**
- Data encryption  
- Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Intrusion detection systems  

## **Administrative Measures**
- Security policies  
- Risk assessment and risk management  

## **Human Factors**
- Social engineering  
- Human errors  
- Training and capacity building

---

# **Key Standards and Frameworks**
- ISO/IEC 27001  
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework  
- HIPAA (USA), PDPA (Thailand)  
- HL7, FHIR health information standards

---

# **Distinct Characteristics of Health Data**
- Highly sensitive by nature  
- Cross-system integration with long-term continuity  
- Requires high precision and reliability  
- Multiple formats:  
  - Textual data, lab results, radiology images, vital signs  
- Used across various healthcare departments

---

# **Health Data Flow**
Patient  
→ Outpatient examination  
→ Medical Records (EMR/EHR)  
→ Laboratory/Radiology units  
→ Specialty clinics  
→ Billing and financial systems  
→ Health network systems  

---

# **Activity 1: Guided Questioning**
Sample questions:  
- Which type of hospital data is most critical for patient care, and why?  
- What might occur if health data were altered?

---

# **Activity 2: Case Study Analysis**
### **(Groups of 4–5 students)**

## **Sample Scenarios**
1. Ransomware attack on a hospital  
2. Staff member sharing patient information through insecure channels  
3. Unauthorized access to a PACS system  

---

# **Analysis Questions**
1. What occurred in the scenario?  
2. Which CIA Triad elements were affected?  
3. What were the root causes (technical, procedural, or human)?  
4. What preventive and corrective measures should be proposed?

---

# **Activity 3: Group Presentation**

- Each group presents for 2–3 minutes  
- Emphasis on reasoning and linkage to information security principles

---

# **Lesson Summary**
- Health data is highly important and extremely sensitive  
- Information security is fundamental for healthcare operations  
- Technical, administrative, and human aspects must work together  
- Awareness and proactive prevention are essential for safeguarding health data
